# Implementation Status

## Completed

### macOS (Darwin)
- ✅ Device enumeration (ListAudioDevices)
- ✅ Get active output device (GetActiveOutputDevice)
- ✅ Set active output device (SetActiveOutputDevice)
- ✅ Device monitoring with callbacks (OnDeviceChange)
- ✅ Event types: DeviceAdded, DeviceRemoved, ActiveDeviceChanged, DeviceDisconnected
- ✅ CoreAudio integration using CGo
- ✅ Property listeners for device changes
- ✅ Device alive monitoring

### Windows
- ✅ Basic structure and COM interfaces defined
- ⚠️ Implementation needs testing on Windows platform
- ✅ Uses go-ole for COM interaction
- ✅ MMDevice and WASAPI interfaces defined

### Cross-platform API
- ✅ Unified AudioDevice struct
- ✅ Platform-agnostic public API
- ✅ Build tags for platform-specific code
- ✅ Event callback system

## Testing
- ✅ Basic unit tests
- ✅ Example programs:
  - list_devices.go - Lists all audio devices
  - monitor_events.go - Monitors device changes
  - switch_device.go - Switches output device
  - device_monitor.go - Real-time device monitoring
  - volume_control.go - Volume control example

## Notes
- The macOS implementation is fully functional and tested
- Windows implementation is structurally complete but needs testing on Windows
- The package successfully enumerates devices, gets/sets active devices, and monitors changes on macOS
- Event monitoring works with proper callbacks for device additions, removals, and changes
